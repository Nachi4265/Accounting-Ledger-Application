## Project Stage ( The Skeleton )
In the Beginning stage of the project the 1st thing I wanted to have working was the user interface (UI) 
I loved woking with Html and Css so I figured I'd get an esay win first and work on the hard things later 
( it also makes it easier (in my opinion) to test the application!)
